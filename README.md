# FileIntegrity
The File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) script is a Python-based tool designed to monitor specified directories for file changes and detect modifications to files in real-time. It uses hashing (SHA-256) for files and captures the last modification timestamp of each file to track when changes occur.
